# Contributing to multiplayer_fabric

## Build

This is a native Godot C++ module. Build with SCons:

```bash
scons dev_build=yes compiledb=yes accesskit=no
```

## Tests

```bash
scons tests=yes dev_build=yes compiledb=yes accesskit=no
bin/godot --test -tc "*MultiplierFabric*"
```

## Zone scaling test

```bash
# Single zone
bin/godot --headless --main-loop FabricZone -- --zone-id 0 --zone-count 1 --scenario concert

# 3-zone fabric with inter-zone migration
for z in 0 1 2; do
  bin/godot --headless --main-loop FabricZone -- --zone-id $z --zone-count 3 --base-port 17500 &
done

# Observer client (windowed) — connects to zone 0 and renders entities
# through the SpectatorRig auto-camera in scenes/observer.tscn.
bin/godot --path modules/multiplayer_fabric/demo/abyssal_vr/ scenes/observer.tscn
```

### CLI arguments

| Argument | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--zone-id N` | 0 | This zone's index (0-based) |
| `--zone-count N` | 3 | Total zones in the fabric |
| `--base-port N` | 17500 | ENet base port (zone binds base+id) |
| `--scenario S` | default | Entity movement pattern — see table below |
| `--player` | | Run as a player client instead of a zone |
| `--player-id N` | 0 | Player ID |
| `--zone-capacity N` | 1800 | Entity slot count per zone (constant-work budget). Headless dedicated: 1800. PCVR co-located 90 Hz: 1024. PCVR co-located 72 Hz: 1200. Must be ≥ 896 (= 16 players × 56 entities; AbyssalSLA.lean minimum) |

### Scenarios

| Scenario | What it simulates |
|----------|-------------------|
| `concert` | 256 audience entities clustered near origin; beats pulse inward once per second. Players appear in CH_INTEREST so all clients see each other plus the performers (also players). |
| `choke_point` | 144 entities cycling through waypoints — crosses zone borders and stresses the migration path. |
| `convoy` | 112 entities in 8 articulated vehicles (Subway Simulator–style trains): 3 cabins per vehicle with 11 passengers distributed across seats; followers read no other entity state. |
| `ragdoll` | Velocity-spike stress test (C7): entities hit 60 m/s when the impulse fires — no static-entity class, every entity is displaceable. |
| `mixed` | All populations simultaneously. |
| `default` | Simple random drift. |

## Documentation style: Hz, seconds, meters

All human-facing prose in `CONCEPT_FABRIC.md`, `README.md`, and any other
reader-facing doc in this module **must** use **Hz, seconds, and meters** as
public units. The word **"tick"** is forbidden in human-facing prose — it
survives only in wire-format field names (`server_tick`, `player_tick`) and
code identifiers. Express durations in seconds/ms, rates in Hz, distances in
meters, velocities in m/s, accelerations in m/s². Tick-rate-dependent values
must be written parametrically (e.g. `pbvh_latency_ticks(hz)`) with the
physical meaning (100 ms) alongside. See
`thirdparty/predictive_bvh/CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full rule and rationale.

## Regenerating predictive_bvh.h

Requires Lean 4 toolchain (`lake`):

```bash
cd thirdparty/predictive_bvh
lake build
lake exe bvh-codegen
```

Outputs `predictive_bvh.h` and `predictive_bvh.rs` in the same directory.
Never hand-edit — the generated code is the source of truth for all Lean-proved formulas.

## Companion projects

See [COMPANION_PROJECTS.md](../../COMPANION_PROJECTS.md) for the full
list of sibling modules and vendored projects that must stay in sync.

## Module structure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `fabric_multiplayer_peer.h/.cpp` | `FabricMultiplayerPeer` — native `MultiplayerPeer` subclass |
| `scene/main/fabric_zone.h/.cpp` | `FabricZone` — headless zone server; runs as player client when launched with `--player` |

Generated (in `thirdparty/predictive_bvh/`):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `predictive_bvh.h` | GENERATED — R128 spatial oracle + cost model |
| `predictive_bvh.rs` | GENERATED — Rust equivalent |

External services:

| Service | URL | Purpose |
|---------|-----|---------|
| uro | https://github.com/V-Sekai/uro | Phoenix/Elixir backend — asset tables, upload, manifest endpoint |
| desync chunk store | https://v-sekai.github.io/casync-v-sekai-game/store | Content-addressable chunk store (zstd blobs, SHA-256 addressed) |
| desync (format spec) | https://github.com/V-Sekai/desync | `.caibx` index format reference |

Third-party (vendored):

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `thirdparty/interaction-system/` | V-Sekai interaction system — GDScript addon that delegates 2D/VR controller input as 3D raycasts into the scene, with canvas-UI support via the Lasso database. Used by players for in-world UI and object interaction. Upstream: https://github.com/V-Sekai/interaction_system |

## Networking channels

| Channel | ID | Mode | Sender | Receiver | Purpose |
|---------|----|------|--------|----------|---------|
| `CH_MIGRATION` | 0 | Reliable ordered | Zone | Zone | STAGING migration intents — zone-to-zone only, never crosses to players |
| `CH_INTEREST` | 1 | Unreliable | Zone | Player | Entity snapshots (100 bytes/entity): position, velocity, acceleration, HLC, payload |
| `CH_PLAYER` | 2 | Unreliable | Player | Zone | Player state and commands — 100 bytes, same skeleton as CH_INTEREST; cmd in payload[0] low byte |

## Lean-proved invariants

These properties are formally verified and must not be violated:

- `owned_to_staging` — Entity transitions from OWNED to STAGING
- `staging_resolves_to_single_owner` — Exactly one owner after commit
- `staging_plus_aborted` — Timeout rollback restores original owner
- `expansion_covers_k_ticks` — Ghost AABB covers all positions within δ ticks
- `surfaceArea_nonneg` — SAH formula soundness

## "Simplify, Then Add Lightness"

In "Simplify, Then Add Lightness," Zack Anderson applies Colin Chapman's famous racecar design philosophy to modern hardware engineering and company-building. Anderson argues that development speed is not generated by heroic effort alone. Instead, it comes from reducing the "mass of the learning loop" by ruthlessly deleting unnecessary requirements and pushing complexity into software.

### Core Lessons

- **Question and subtract requirements:** The fastest teams rigorously examine which parts of a specification are not absolutely necessary.
- **Sequence your risks:** Early prototypes should act like scientific experiments designed to retire specific risks in order, rather than trying to prove everything at once.
- **Insource the uncertain:** While mature, standardized components can be outsourced, core uncertainties should be kept in-house.
- **Shift complexity to software:** Teams should aim to make products "software defined" by replacing physical complexity with computation.
- **Compress learning loops:** Distance between engineers and the product acts as a direct tax on speed.
- **Maintain organizational lightness:** Headcount should be kept small enough to naturally share context.

Ultimately, whenever a program feels slow, teams should not ask how to go faster, but rather what unnecessary burdens they are carrying that can be dropped.
